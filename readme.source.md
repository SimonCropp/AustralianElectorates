## Maps

All maps are in [geojson format](http://geojson.org/).

The following grouping of maps exist:

 * Future (Next election) [/Data/Maps/Future](/Data/Maps/Future)
 * 2019 election [/Data/Maps/2019](/Data/Maps/2019)
 * 2016 election [/Data/Maps/2016](/Data/Maps/2016)


### Structure

Each of the above groupings have the following structure.

 * Australia and state "combined electorate" maps are at the root.
 * Specific electorate maps are located inside a subdirectory based on the state they exist in.


### Map variants

Each maps has multiple variants based on simplification.

With the two options combined, there are 5 different options for each map.

Below is the combinations for [Bass](https://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/tas/bass.htm)

| Size  | File name                                                        | Simplification |
| -----:| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------:|
| 2.8MB | [bass.geojson](/Data/Maps/Future/Electorates/bass.geojson)       | none           |
| 231KB | [bass_20.geojson](/Data/Maps/Future/Electorates/bass_20.geojson) | 20%            |
| 94KB  | [bass_10.geojson](/Data/Maps/Future/Electorates/bass_10.geojson) | 10%            |
| 46KB  | [bass_05.geojson](/Data/Maps/Future/Electorates/bass_05.geojson) | 5%             |
| 8KB   | [bass_01.geojson](/Data/Maps/Future/Electorates/bass_01.geojson) | 1%             |


#### Simplification

Simplification uses [MapShaper simplify option](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/wiki/Command-Reference#-simplify)

> Visvalingam simplification iteratively removes the least important point from a polyline. The importance of points is measured using a metric based on the geometry of the triangle formed by each non-endpoint vertex and the two neighboring vertices

The level of simplification is represented as a percent number. 20, 10, 5, and 1. representing 20%, 10%, 5%, and 1%. The smaller the number the smaller the file, but with the loss of some accuracy.


## NuGets

The NuGets contain a static copy of all the electorate data. This data is embedded as resources inside the assembly. No network calls are done by the assembly. To get the latests version of the data do a NuGet update. There are several options to help keep a NuGet update:

 * [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/): Creates pull requests to keep your dependencies secure and up-to-date.
 * [Using NuGet wildcards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/package-versioning#version-ranges-and-wildcards).
 * [Libraries.io](https://libraries.io/): Supports subscribing to NuGet package updates.
